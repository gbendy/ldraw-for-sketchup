LDraw-for-SketchUp
==================

LDraw Tools for SketchUp

----
28 Nov 2012

 * Added a basic .ldr exporter.
  * Exports entire model. 
  * Exports only Component Instances. 
  * Instance Definition names should match LDraw part number without the
   .dat extension.

26 Nov 2012 - Updates

* Plugin appears in the `Plugins/LDraw menu`.
* Import `.ldr` files.
* Import parts by LDraw Number.

Parts/models are imported to the Component Browser, not directly in the model.

Currently requires LDraw to be installed to `C:\Program Files (x86)\LDraw`
