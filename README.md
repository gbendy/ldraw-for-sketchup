LDraw Tools for SketchUp

----

26 Nov 2012 - Updates

* Plugin appears in the `Plugins/LDraw menu`.
* Import `.ldr` files.
* Import parts by LDraw Number.

Parts/models are imported to the Component Browser, not directly in the model.

Currently requires LDraw to be installed to `C:\Program Files (x86)\LDraw`

The `src/` folder will contain the stable plugin files.
